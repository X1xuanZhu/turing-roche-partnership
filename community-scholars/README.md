# Turing-Roche Community Scholars

The Turing-Roche Community Scholar Scheme is a year long programme supporting 10 UK based PhD students to embed themselves within the Turing-Roche Partnership, undertake a community project and attend a relevant conference. 

You can find out more about our 10 scholars [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership/community-scholars). This GitHub folder contains a list of conferences our scholars will be attending and also information on their community projects.
