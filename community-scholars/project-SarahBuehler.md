# Community Scholar Project: Translational science methods club 
## Sarah Buehler

### Overview of planned project
I would like to start a translational science methods club that brings together members of Turing, Roche as well as the wider academic but also clinical community to focus on how we can translate from data to science to clinic.  
This should foster discussion on how to deal with data, inference and the populations we study, addressing questions such as how to deal with different types of data, what inferences can be made from the methods we use and how this can capture and benefit patient populations.

The sessions should involve interactive discussion of the translational aspect of science methods (data to inference to generalization) and the audience and speakers will be asked to discuss the following: what research questions and data can/can't this method be applied to? What are the assumptions and limitations? What inferences can/can't be made and how do they generalize to the populations studied? Audience members are encouraged to share their own experiences with methods and ask the speakers about applicability to data sets or use cases they have in mind/encountered.


### Milestones

#### Quarter 1 (September, October, November)
- [ ] Develop, refine and order list of potential topics and speakers from Academia, Roche and Turing
- [ ] Begin advertising the methods club
- [ ] Get in touch with potential speakers and check potential availability. 
- [ ] Aim to hold session in November.

#### Quarter 2 (December, January, February)
- [ ] Aim to hold session in January 
- [ ] Collate feedback from previous sessions to refine and continue developing the format
- [ ] Progress Report

#### Quarter 3 (March, April, May)
- [ ] Aim to hold session in March
- [ ] Aim to hold session in March

#### Quarter 4 (June, July, August)
- [ ] Aim to hold second session July
- [ ] Final Report 


### How the community can connect with the project
