Topic: Collaborators and researchers quiz battle

Contents

Divide collaborators and researchers into 2 teams and compete their scores by answering questions in each video. The right to answer is determined by a quick raising hands after the question has been read out by the host. If a team is stuck answering for more than 10 seconds, the right to answer goes to another team.
Questions will be of 3 types:
Easy questions (1 point) - Publicly stated information (Their research, background, reasons why they joined the project, etc.)
Neutral questions (3 points) - Slightly personal information (Memory of their PhD, project, and conference, etc.)
