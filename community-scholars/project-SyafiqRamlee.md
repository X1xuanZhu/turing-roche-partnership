# Community Scholar Project: #ExplainToMe Animated Video Series
## Syafiq Ramlee

### Overview of planned project
This community project, #ExplainToMe, is an animated video series that aims to raise public understanding and awareness of the interests of the Turing-Roche strategic partnership. The series will consist of three bite-sized videos (each about 2-3 minutes short) and covers some of the scientific problems and themes that the partnership is tackling. The content will be delivered in a very high-level manner to make it easy for a lay audience to grasp.

Work on the videos will begin in September 2023, with anticipated release in the summer of 2024 onto the partnershipâ€™s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtDFLOFg1QBVfPUl5Ei9-Mg) and across Turing and Roche social media spaces (Slack, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook).
