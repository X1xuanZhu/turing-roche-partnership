# Community Scholar Project: Podcast on health data
## Florence Townend & Davy Tennison

### Overview of planned project
We are recording and publishing a podcast on how health data is used currently and what the current research is on topics 
such as but not limited to: wearables, health-tech apps, data representativeness, multi-modal data fusion, health economics, and AI in hospitals.
The plan is to release 8 episodes over the course of the year, each around 20-40 minutes long, with at least one guest in each 
episode.
An additional aim of the project is to produce short clips for Tiktok/Instagram reels and to engage with the listeners through a gmail account for questions etc.

The episodes will feature Florence and Davy speaking about each topic in a light-hearted, conversational way - each bringing tpoics and research papers forward to discuss together.
