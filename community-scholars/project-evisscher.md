# Community Scholar Project: Techercise
## Ellen Visscher

### Overview of planned project
The aim of techercise is to share knowledge on how to perform research and improve productivity and reproducibility by using the right tools or approaches. The project will consist of a series of sessions, each with a different topic. The sessions will be held every two months, and will be open to members of the Turing/Roche/wider community. The sessions will consist of a speaker or a number of speakers and some will be interactive. Some initial ideas for topics are: how to do code review, how to get the most out of your IDE or how to critically analyse a machine learning paper. Depending on engagement, we would also like to pilot pairing people for peer code review.

### How the community can connect with the project
The Turing-Roche partnership slack for now, but we aim to create a dedicated slack channel for the project, and will update this accordingly.
The community can also contact me directly with any ideas, feedback or questions.
