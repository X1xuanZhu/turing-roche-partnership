# Structured Missingness funding call Q&A

Slides from the session [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OSm_9pgg1e7ILMIPJRC8PycXsNk3NqbW/view?usp=sharing).


###### What effects will be seconded to Turing have on my pension and other benefits at my university? 

There shouldn't be any implications. The individual will carry on paying into their pension via their University, and Turing simply reimburses the costs to the University along with salary and NI (all pro-rata). We advise you to please discuss this further with your employer. 


###### Does secondment mean I’m not working full time for my university?

You will remain employed by your university at the FTE in your employment contract. 


###### Can I be seconded part time e.g 20% of my time?

Yes that’s fine. If you are applying as part of a collaborative team then you can also have different team members seconded different amounts e.g the PI seconded for 20% of time, the postdoc 50% etc.


###### I’m working in a collaborative team and it is a lot of admin to submit head of department approval and finance approval letters from everyone. Will one suffice?

We don’t want admin to be a blocker for applications, so one letter from the research/finance office of each university involved in the grant confirming the research/finance office and if applicable, Head of Department, agree with the terms will be sufficient. You can find an example template letter [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qGJ1LjfLNT2Yg8rSC7u0aoyliFmNSBnyE8EtZopOuMk/edit?usp=sharing). 

##### If we are working in a collaborative project across universities, will the lead university receive the funding or will it be sent to both?_

As individuals will be seconded from their university to The Turing, all payments will be made directly to the university for which the secondee is employed by. 


###### There is reference to a funding template, where and what is this? Why can’t we use our own template? 

The template is available under the Flexigrant application under ‘Project Details’ ‘Proposed Budget’. To ensure we are able to provide a fair, transparent and prompt review of all proposals the same template is required for all proposals. 


###### I’m struggling to calculate the overhead cost and include this in the funding template. 

The funding template already includes Turing overhead rates which are hard coded, the total of which appears in column P (hidden). You therefore don’t need to add the Turing overhead rate costs. 


###### What is the ballpark for budget- how much is too much?

If you can justify your resources then we’re happy to fund large projects. However if we feel your project is too large i.e you’ve said you need 18 months but we think 12 months would be more appropriate then we may come back to you and offer ‘lower’. You can think of the funding as project funding rather than ‘programme’ funding.

As a very rough estimate we’re looking to fund 5-7 projects that have a PI, and a postdoc or two but we’d be happy to fund smaller or larger projects than this if we think the science is good.


###### You said you’re looking for Open Science- how will this work with sensitive data?

We’ll be aiming to work ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. The Turing-Roche partnership has committed to publishing methodology and algorithms openly, however we recognise there are limitations when it comes to the security and privacy of patient data and will ensure we handle those examples sensitively. 


###### My collaborators are struggling to get their departmental approvals and I’m not sure this will happen by the closing date- what shall I do?

We suggest you submit anyway as we’re keen to receive all applications. If some collaborators are unable to continue yet your sole project is shortlisted, we will endeavour to find a solution to proceed. 


###### Do we have to use the Roche CDGB database?

No- this was just a database that fit nicely with the missingness example we were exploring and is a nice database to exemplify applications in this area, but more than happy for you to use other databases. We see structured missinginess as being a challenge that appears in many scenarios and would want methodology developed to address it to be transferable to other applications. 


###### What research questions/approaches are currently being looked at in the CDGB database?

The CGDB database is very rich and could be used in a wide number of ways. Some examples of questions which could be addressed with the CGDB include:



* Identifying patient subgroups which respond strongly to particular treatments
* Developing prognostic models to predict outcome of patients based upon clinical and genomic factors
* Identifying subgroups of patients with poor outcomes i.e. patients with unmet medical need
* Epidemiological questions i.e. understanding the characteristics of specific patient groups


###### Is this funding call methodology or application focused?

The focus of the partnership is around developing methodology which ideally can be used in a variety of scenarios. We want this methodology to be developed with applications in mind and a powerful way of demonstrating the value of a newly demonstrated methodology is in applying it to a real dataset.

We are also committed to open science, and want the outcomes of this research to be made available to the wider community. If the application is going to be sensitive for either commercial or other reasons, this may be limiting and so a less sensitive application may allow for wider dissemination.

We would not be funding what we would consider a pure application project such as  applying an existing or standard technique to a new database to uncover new insights within that data.


###### Will planning for future work i.e plans to apply for another grant after this one to develop software, be seen as a downside?

Not at all, would be great to hear the downstream ideas for your projects and happy for you to continue work as long as the methodology has been developed during this project.


###### How will successful applicants be able to access the CDGB database?

Apollo is Roche’s Trusted Research Environment through which access to the CGDB will be provided for those successful projects which require it. Apollo has a standard range of data science tools (including RStudio and Jupyter notebooks) with the capability to add additional functionality if needed. Access to Apollo will be through a Roche laptop which will be provided to all members of funded projects which require it.

Apollo was assessed by the Turing team for its suitability as a platform for data analysis for the Turing-Roche partnership and you can find the report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pCNyR2T6AIi8lT5Wb2RuWBhnV5CwIX4E/view?usp=sharing). This report is a writeup of a short evaluation exercise and has not been formally reviewed. Although we intend that it should provide a fair and accurate summary of the TRE from a user perspective for the purposes of this call, we do not guarantee that any instance of the Roche TRE is exactly as described. **Please do not share the report outside of this funding call**.


###### If we would like to utilise the Turing Research Engineering Group (REG) members for our project do we need to cost that in?

We’re keen for you to utilise the resources available as the Turing-Roche partnership. Resource such as the Turing REG team time doesn’t need to be costed in as it's a Turing internal resource, however they are a busy team and we’d need details of what you need from them so this can be scheduled 6+ months in advance with them. 

You will also have support from the Roche Apollo (TRE) team, similarly we would encourage including this in your application so advance warning of what you will be requiring from them can be given to help them manage their scheduling.
