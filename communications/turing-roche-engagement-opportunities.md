# The Alan Turing Institute Engagement Opportunities  


### Background

The [Turing-Roche Strategic partnership](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership) launched in June 2021. We are keen to build strong connections and collaborations between the two organisations. This document contains opportunities at the Alan Turing Institute we feel may be of interest to the Roche Data Science Community and beyond. You can sign up for more regular updates via our Turing-Roche newsletter [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership#contact-info).

The Turing Institute is set up with sector specific [research programmes](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes), such as the such as the [Health and Medical Sciences research programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/health-and-medical-sciences), which is what the Turing-Roche strategic partnership sits under. There are also cross-cutting programmes such as Public Policy, Safe and Ethical AI, and the [Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS) programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) which is focused on building open source infrastructure. Most of the opportunities below sit within the Health and TPS programmes. 


### **Events**

General Turing Institute events are listed [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events). Upcoming events are listed regularly. Often, past event pages provide a short overview of the outcome and the recordings are posted on the [Turing YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheAlanTuringInstituteUK).

**Tools, Practises and Systems (TPS) Seminar Series**

The TPS seminar takes place on the last Wednesday of every month and is attended by a broad audience from the Turing. We have had some great external speakers such as Digital Public Goods Alliance and OpenMined and would welcome a speaker from Roche. Our research project manager for TPS, Arielle Bennett, would be able to advise on topics of interest.

**AI-UK - Turing’s Annual Conference**

Every March, the Turing Institute hosts its flagship two-day conference, 
AI UK- showcasing the latest developments in artificial intelligence (AI) research, applied to the most pressing challenges across multiple disciplines.

There are opportunities to submit talks as well as host interactive workshops.

### **Interest Groups**

[Interest groups](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups) allow researchers at the Turing to develop knowledge around a shared interest in data science and/or AI. Most are open for external people to join (we are keen ton welcome Roche members) and if not clear then the organiser of the group is always happy to be contacted.

Some that may be potentially of interest:



* [Omics data generation and analysis group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/omics-data-generation-and-analysis-group)
* [Visualization](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/visualization)
* [Data Science Education](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/data-science-education)
* [Causal Inference](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/causal-inference)
* [Facilitating Responsible Participation in Data Science](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/facilitating-responsible-participation-data-science)


## **Open Research Projects**

**The Turing Way**

[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) is a guide to reproducible data science and beyond: providing information that researchers and data scientists in academia, industry and the public sector need to ensure that the projects they work on are easy to reproduce and reuse. The book launched in January 2019 and now has a large collaborative community contributing to it.

We would love to have any contributions to the Turing Way from the Roche Community. We would also be more than happy to introduce the Roche community to the Turing Way via a talk, workshop or training on computational reproducibility. You can find several ways to join and get involved in The Turing Way listed in [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/demo-intro). Here are some opportunities and events to collaboratively work on The Turing Way book on data science.



* [Slack channel](https://tinyurl.com/jointuringwayslack)
* [Co-working calls](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-weekly.html) - weekly collaboration calls (1 hour)
* [Collaboration cafes](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html) - biweekly onboarding collaboration, quiet working and dicussion calls (2 hours)
* [Book Dash events](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html) - 1 week long event to work flexibly work with others

**Turing Data Stories**

A Turing Data Story is an interactive mix of narrative, code, and visuals that derives insight from real world open data. They are written as pedagogic Jupyter notebooks that aim to spark curiosity and motivate more people to play with data.

The project is collaboratively developed on Github [in this repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/TuringDataStories/) and the stories are published online. [Check them out here](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/TuringDataStories-fastpages/).

Roche researchers are invited to contribute their data stories to share with the Turing community and more widely through this open source platform.


## **Data Study Groups- collaborative hackathons**

[Data Study Groups](https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/data-study-groups) are an event series that bring together some of the country’s top talent from data science, artificial intelligence, and wider fields, to analyse real-world data science challenges. Organisations act as Data Study Group ‘Challenge Owners’, providing real-world problems to be tackled by small groups of highly talented, carefully selected researchers who brainstorm and engineer data science solutions, presenting their work at the end of the week.

All researchers are given skill training on best practices in data science, project leadership and professional workshops to support them to work in the interface of academia and industry.

All DSGs publish a comprehensive final report (found [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/data-study-groups#reports)) which covers an overview of the dataset(s) used, methodologies, analyses, results and future work. DSG's can be used by challenge owners as a pilot study and often lead to larger projects/collaborations- Roche were previously a challenge owner with the DSG leading to setting up the Turing-Roche strategic partnership.

Any Roche researchers would be welcome to apply to join any future DSG's as researchers.


## **Skills and Training**

The institute’s training teams runs a variety of internal programmes, courses and national activities. Their Github can be found [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/learning-at-the-turing).

They are developing a new website which will be launched in early January and will give more information on the activities below.

**Research Data Science training**

The [Research Engineering team](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research-engineering) are close collaborators of the TPS programmme and we feel there may be some overlapping interests with this team and the Roche Advanced Analytics Network (RAAN).

They have developed and delivered [Research Data Science courses](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rds-course/) in the past. Any future opportunities for courses will be flagged as Roche members would be welcome to attend.

**The Turing Fellow Programme**

Turing Research Fellows are independent researchers, employed by one of the Turing’s partner universities and based at the Institute. They were recruited following success in an internationally competitive process. The objective of Turing Research Fellows is to develop a personal research programme at the Turing to conduct outstanding, creative and innovative research in data science and artificial intelligence, develop internationally significant outcomes, and play a prominent role in advancing the research programmes of the Institute and its partners, acting as project.

**Opportunities for doctoral students**

The Turing offers multiple opportunities for doctoral researchers to work with its community. An interesting scheme for Roche network is [Enrichment Programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment). This will give students undertaking a PhD the opportunity to support and enhance their current research by accessing the facilities and opportunities available at The Alan Turing Institute and its partners. Students usually join us in their second or third years of a typical doctorate to further the work they are undertaking for their research project and support the completion of the PhD. More info [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships).

## **Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI)**

The Turing Institute launched its first EDI strategy and accompanying action plan in September 2021. You can find the strategy and action plan at the bottom of the page [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us/equality-diversity-and-inclusion).

Whilst many of the activities are institute based, we will be launching a research programme in ‘EDI in data science and AI research’ next year which will include research and training programme delivery, and will support sharing of best practice through external stakeholder engagement, community building (internally and externally), knowledge transfer and the seeding of new opportunities.

Will send over info as the programme and other EDI Turing Initiatives develop.


## Potential upcoming opportunities
