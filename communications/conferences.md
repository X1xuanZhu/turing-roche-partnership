# Conferences of interest to Turing-Roche Partnership

(Need to decide on overall aim for conferences and what we want to achieve- are we attending to information gather or presenting to showcase our research/knowledge share- or both!)

**Potential conferences for 2022**

* March 21st-23rd [International Public Health Conference](https://public-health.magnusconferences.com/program/scientific-sessions/biostatistics-in-public-health). May be out of scope but have a Biostatistics in Public Health Section. Probably too late for this year but perhaps for 2023
* June 12th-15th [Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry PSI 2022](https://www.psiweb.org/conferences/about-the-conference). Had an ‘Assessment and Discovery of Treatment Effect Heterogeneity’ [session ](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/assessment-discovery-treatment-effect-heterogeneity-psi-psi-community/)at last years conference. Have missed abstracts/poster submission deadlines. Early bird registration deadline 25th March 
* July 18th-22nd [European Meeting of Statisticians](https://ems2022.org/). Quite broad- unsure of topics yet. Deadline for abstracts May 20th 
* August 6th-11th [Joint Statistical Meetings](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2022/conferenceinfo.cfm). Quite broad but brings together a lot of groups. Have missed abstracts/poster submission deadlines. Registration opens May 2nd 
* August 21st-25th [Annual Conference of the International Society for Clinical Biostatistics](https://www.iscb2022.info/). Seems very relevant for the partnership- missing data is a conference topic. Abstract deadline 14th March 
* October 13th-16th [IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics](http://dsaa2022.dsaa.co/). Includes calls for Industry Posters and tutorials. Paper submission 15th May, special session paper submission 1st June, tutorials submission 15th June, industry poster submission 26th June
* October 19th-21st [Non-Clinical Statistics Conference](https://ncs-conference.org/). Causal inference listed as a topic. Abstract submission 31st March
* November 8th-10th [BioData World Congress](https://www.terrapinn.com/conference/biodata/index.stm) Digital transformation in pharma and healthcare. Looks like you can still request to speak.
* November 26th- December 4th [2022 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems](https://nips.cc/Conferences/FutureMeetings). Quite technical- machine learning and computational neuroscience. No registration/submission deadlines yet. In the past Roche has sponsored the Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) track and given sponsor remarks

**Potential conferences for 2023**

* January 9th-11th [2023 International Conference on Health Policy Statistics](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/ichps/2023/index.cfm). Could be interesting if we want to influence policy. Abstract deadline June 30th 2022.

**Others**

* ‘Evidence and the Individual Patient: Understanding Heterogeneous Treatment Effects for Patient-Centered Care’ was a one-off past conference in 2018. Was funded by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute, [PCORI](https://www.pcori.org/) and was run by Predictive Analytics and Comparative Effectiveness Center, [PACE](https://www.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/research-clinical-trials/institutes-centers-labs/institute-for-clinical-research-and-health-policy-studies/research-programs/center-for-predictive-analytics-and-comparative-effectivness) at Tufts- keep an eye out for future events 
* [Centre for Statistical Methodology at LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-statistical-methodology/events) runs regular events which seem relevant to the partnership’s research area- may be opportunities to speak
