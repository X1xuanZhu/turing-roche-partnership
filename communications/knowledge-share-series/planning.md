# Turing-Roche Partnership Seminar Series and Knowledge Shares

### Overall Aims

-   Strengthen connections between Turing and Roche, exchange knowledge and build potential new collaborations/projects

-   To help build and maintain a community in the area of Treatment and/or Data Heterogeneity. Can start off in this area 

-   Promote the partnership- collaborative working between Roche (industry) and Turing (academia) and showcase research the partnership produces

### Audience

-   Can target Biostatisticians/Medical Statisticians, Bioinformaticians/Clinical Informaticians, Mathematical Scientists, Network Scientists 

-   But also welcome general public health researchers, general data scientists- anyone interested in this area

### Current Ideas

-   Brainstormed 2 different event types:

-   A 'traditional' seminar series: Introduction to the partnership, one speaker from Turing (or Turing Network) and one from Roche, then Q&A/discussion

-   A more 'casual' networking/knowledge share series: Potential format of networking, then lightning talks and breakout rooms for Q&A/further discussion. Perhaps keep this one more 'internal'- focus on building connections between Turing and Roche

-   Suggest we run a first 'season' pilot version of both of these events in April-June (i.e seminars in April and June and knowledge shares in May and July) and then re-visit in summer with an August break and decide which we want to run regularly (or both). Want to use these as a bit of an experiment- can try out hybrid versions etc and keep an agile mindset- i.e tweak if they're not working. Suggest April and May to be online only just to get us set up initially then can experiment with hybrid in June and July.

-   Can expand other ideas out as we go e.g podcasts: guardrail = methodological / data / innovation topics.

### Themes

-   Structured Missingness (the first major theme of the partnership)

-   Predictive Modelling - (likely to be a theme of the partnership - certainly an area of interest to lots of people)

-   Good Data Science practice (thinking about Turing Way)

-   Ethics (starting to get some interest in Roche - something we could learn about from Turing )

-   Multimodality research (imaging + biomarker + digital marker -> clinical outcomes),

-   RWD/E generation for drug dev: e.g. informative presence in RW databases

-   Digital health product dev. 

-   Endpoint strategy: digital data? Meaningful change? (particularly challenging in Neuroscience) [Yajing can FU]

-   National AI strategy?  Roche's interest: showcase pharma work, share challenges on early evidence generation/piloting, possibly in partnership with NHS? Focus is on better and holistic personalised healthcare.

-   Personalised dynamic prediction and its application in Neuroscience and Oncology. Data= real-world electronic medical records/registry. (2-year Roche UCAM methods collab.; Roche PI: Yajing, UCAM PI: Jessica): can co-present?

-   Structured Missingness round 2 (get our funded projects to present their preliminary results)

-   [UCL pharmaco-epi data collaborative | UCL Research Domains - UCL -- University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research/domains/eresearch/fostering-interdisciplinary-research/ucl-pharmaco-epi-data-collaborative), [(1) UCL Pharmaco-Epi Collaborative (@ucl_pharm_epi) / Twitter](https://twitter.com/ucl_pharm_epi) interesting new network- could be good for a talk?

### Logistics

-   Start in April 2022.  Would like to plan out speakers and themes for next few months in advance. Potential speakers- Turing and Roche employees, Structured Missingness Workshop Attendees, Partnership Expert Panel, SM funded project teams, researchers from Turing Networks

-   Stick to same date and time in the month for consistency

-   Can register users through Zoom and if we give Turing Events team enough notice they can create an event entry on the Turing site- [Events | The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events) 

-   Promotion via Turing-Roche Newsletter, Turing Health Newsletter, Roche social media and Roche newsletters (?), RAAN distribution list. Will send out to Turing University Leads and University Liaison Managers. VH will tweet out and tag relevant twitter accounts. Can also use Roche corporate comms to drop event into people's calendars- over 1000 people!

-   VH's Zoom account has a maximum of 300 attendees so think this would be suitable to use. Turing Events team can upload recording to YouTube post the event. Zoom account also has capability to stream to YouTube but would worry about internet bandwidth for that! Not sure much advantage to this as people can join the Zoom.

### Considerations

-   Current 'meeting fatigue'- could struggle for attendance/engagement 

-   Hybrid meetings are difficult to pull off- hard to ensure parity between online and in person attendees

-   May be hard to measure success- can look at new collaborations/projects but might not always be clear if they connected through these events

-   Time Zone- want to try and make the event as global as possible. 3pm UK time works well for most time zones but may interfere with UK school run- will reassess after April's event.

### Event Checklist
*Pre- Event Checklist*

- [ ]  Date

- [ ]   Choose a 'theme' for the event: 

- [ ]   Select 1 speaker from Turing (and Turing Network) and 1 from Roche. Would be nice to have a mix of career stages. 

- [ ]  Create Zoom registration link

- [ ]  Create event page on Turing website with Turing events team

- [ ]  Invite speakers

- [ ]   Get bios, photos and brief descriptions of speakers talk for the event page

- [ ]   VH to tweet out event and tag relevant accounts

- [ ]   VH to email Turing University Leads (TULs), University Liaison Managers (ULMs) and Alan Yabsley for Turing Network Development Awards to get them to promote event to networks

- [ ]  Email Turing communications so it can be included in Turing Bulletin/newsletters

- [ ]  Submit a form for linkedin/twitter turing posts

- [ ]  Email interest groups for them to promote to networks

- [ ]  Event to be included in Turing Roche Newsletter

- [ ] Event to be included in Turing Health Newsletter

- [ ]  Event to be added to Mathison- Turing internal net

- [ ]  Event to be shared through Turing Slack Channels and other Slack workspaces

- [ ]  Event to be shared with Roche social media team and corporate communications for promotion

- [ ]   Prep meeting- run through over Zoom meeting with the speakers to ensure comfortable and ready for the event

- [ ]  Have a Slack conversation starter thread ready to go during/straight after the event?

*Event running*

1 hour event:

- [ ]  5 min introduction by VH, Zoom logistics, code of conduct, few slides on partnership, run through format/agenda of session

- [ ]  2 talks at 15 mins each- 35 mins. Poll in crossover bit?

- [ ]   20 mins- Q&A discussion session- run it a bit like a panel, in slido say people can ask specific questions to a speaker but also encourage questions that all speakers can comment on.

Could try out optional networking at the end of the event, see if anyone hangs around?

*Post- Event Checklist*

- [ ]  Encourage conversations about the event in Slack

- [ ]  Upload video to Turing-Roche YouTube

- [ ]  Note down attendance and other stats to gauge interest
