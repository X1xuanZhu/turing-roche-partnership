## Introduction to The Alan Turing Institute 

The Alan Turing Institute, headquartered in the British Library, London, was created as the national institute for data science in 2015. In 2017, as a result of a government recommendation, we added artificial intelligence to our remit. Introduction video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjS2sVPR2Zc).

The Institute is named in honour of Alan Turing (23 June 1912 -- 7 June 1954), whose pioneering work in theoretical and applied mathematics, engineering and computing are considered to be the key disciplines comprising the fields of data science and artificial intelligence.

Five founding universities -- Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford, UCL and Warwick -- and the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council created The Alan Turing Institute in 2015.

Eight new universities -- Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Queen Mary University of London, Birmingham, Exeter, Bristol, and Southampton -- joined the Institute in 2018

The Institute has 3 ambitious goals:

-   Advance world-class research and apply it to real-world problems: innovate and develop world-class research in data science and artificial intelligence that supports next generation theoretical developments and is applied to real-world problems, generating the creation of new businesses, services, and jobs.

-   Train the leaders of the future: train new generations of data science and AI leaders with the necessary breadth and depth of technical and ethical skills to match the UK's growing industrial and societal needs.

-   Lead the public conversation: through agenda-setting research, public engagement, and expert technical advice, drive new and innovative ideas which have a significant influence on industry, government, regulation, or societal views, or which have an impact on how data science and artificial intelligence research is undertaken.

The Institute's research spans a [huge range of disciplines](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research) and over [400 researchers](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers) collaborate at the Turing. There are 10 [current research programmes](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research#current-programmes) - the Turing-Roche Partnership sits under the [Health programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/health-and-medical-sciences).

The Institute also has a number of partnerships and collaborations, many of which are health related. Roche is our first pharmaceutical strategic partner.

The Turing Values - we have established these values that we expect our community to demonstrate.

## Introduction to the Turing-Roche Strategic Partnership 

The Turing Institute and Roche have a history of collaboration over the past few years. We initially collaborated as two organisations through a [Turing Data Study Group ](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/publications/data-study-group-final-report-roche)(collaborative hackathon hosted by Turing) in April 2019, before a [12 week research project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-and-roche-towards-tailor-made-lung-cancer-treatment) in the same year exploring predictive computational models for the lung cancer treatment.

We then launched our five year Strategic Partnership in June 2021- you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq7f-YnVKtg) from our kick off event.

The guiding North Star for the partnership is  "to enable the generation of insights to better understand patient and disease heterogeneity and its relevance to clinical outcomes at an unprecedented level of precision in order to improve clinical care". 

We'll be covering multiple activities and exploring different research areas and themes to reach our North Star, as well as building new connections and collaborations between the two organisations and the wider community. 

Our partnership webpage can be found [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership).

### Current Partnership Activities 

##### Structured Missingness Research Theme

Our first activity as a partnership was exploring the area of Structured Missingness (SM). We ran 3 virtual collaborative workshops with 40 attendees in November/December 2021 to explore different issues in SM. The attendees then developed collaborative research project ideas that they delivered as short presentations in the final workshop. You can find the full report on the workshops [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2021-12/structured_missingness_report.pdf).

We then ran an associated funding call to support projects generated during the workshops. The two projects are detailed here:

##### Structured Missingness Projects

Using Network Science to Quantify the Geometry of Missingness

CO-I: Ginestra Bianconi

CO-I: Ruben Sanchez-Garcia

PDRA: Anthony Baptista

Start: 01/09/2022

End: 01/02/24

Project Abstract: 

The goal of this proposal is to develop a data driven mathematical and computational platform to extract and analyse the geometrical organization of patterns of missingness in complex, heterogeneous datasets. A necessary step in dealing with missing data is understanding its underlying structure. Networks, and their higher-order generalisations, provide a natural mathematical model to represent potentially very intricate patterns of missingness in data, and allow us access to powerful tools in network analysis and discrete topology to uncover the hidden organisational structure. Our main assumption is that structural missingness can be better represented and understood using the tools of network analysis and discrete topology in a way that is complementary to statistical and machine learning approaches.

We will use state-of-the art information theory tools to evaluate not only pairwise but also higher-order measures of mutual information between features in a dataset (using the Roche clinico-genomic [CGDB] dataset as an exemplar) under some null hypotheses that represent "random" patterns of missingness. We will represent these measures using pairwise and higher-order networks to give us a powerful mathematical model of the patterns of missingness in the dataset. Finally, we will combine network and topological analysis tools to characterize the architecture of the structural missingness networks including clusters, node centrality and persistent features. We will use this information to understand the deviation from the null hypotheses and to assess the degree to which patterns of missingness are structured, and the extent to which missingness depends on the available information about a patient.

Developing a coherent Bayesian modelling and imputation framework

CO-I: Robin Mitra

CO-I: Ana Basiri, Eleni-Roaslina Andrinopoulou

PDRA: James Jackson

Start: 01/09/2022

End: 01/02/24

Project Abstract: 

Analysis of large complex datasets is increasingly essential for scientific research. Missing data is a common complication impeding effective use of the data. In particular, missing values commonly arise here with an associated structure. These can occur for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, merging of different data sources across different individuals and variables, complex and varied data collection practices, and underlying latent dependencies characterising missingness processes. 

Multiple imputation is an appealing approach to dealing with the missing values, largely removing the missingness burden for analysts. However, Structured Missingness (SM) presents unique challenges. Notably situations where it is implausible to impute missing values that cannot exist. Instead, a fully model-based approach can be taken whereby inferences are made by applying the model of interest directly to the observed data. However, these models can be challenging to formulate with incomplete data and less appealing when imputation is appropriate. 

This proposal unifies both model-based and imputation-based approaches for SM through Bayesian methods that permit model-based inferences while simultaneously imputing missing values where this is plausible. Bayesian methods are appealing with the ability to naturally fit complex models, combine multiple sources of information, and include external information into the modelling framework. 

This proposal utilises these components to develop novel methods for effective analysis of large complex data affected by SM. The last component presents another important novel dimension, whereby we utilise the presence of SM as information itself, incorporating this in the Bayesian framework to improve methodology for addressing SM.

##### Predictive Modelling Research Theme

Our second research theme is predictive modelling- looking at this within the lens of uncertainty and heterogeneity in biomedical data. Machine-Learning based predictive models have achieved success in a wide range of real life applications, but often the power and potential of the models comes down to their robustness in the face of data uncertainty i.e noisy data, biased data, missing data etc. This theme was scoped by our Senior Postdoctoral Research Associate Rohan Chakraborty and we decided to break the theme down into three sub-themes for further exploration:

-   Generalisation despite heterogeneity: developing models that perform robustly in the face of data heterogeneity and generalise across patient heterogeneity

-   Prediction uncertainty in personalised healthcare: quantifying the uncertainty of personalised (as opposed to generalised) predictions at the individual patient level made from models trained at the population level

-   Algorithmic explainability and fairness for responsible AI: developing models that perform fairly across different patient subgroups and the decision process is interpretable and transparent

We ran an in-person, collaborative workshop on the 11th October 2022 where we convened a group of 35 researchers to explore the sub-themes, have discussions and start putting together research ideas. A full report on the workshop is [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2022-11/predictive_modelling_workshop_2022_report.pdf).

We are running an associated funding call in this area which closed on the 14th November 2022. Successful funded projects will be announced in 2023.

#### Community Activities 

The partnership is also aiming to build connections between Turing, Roche and the wider community interested in patient heterogeneity. We have a number of regular community activities and tools that we would strongly encourage you to get involved in as part of the partnership.

-   Monthly Newsletter - sent around the 10th of every month and features partnership updates, opportunities, events and news from both organisations and the wider community. You can [comment on the newsletter issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-roche-partnership/issues) on our GitHub repo with anything you'd like included before the 9th of each month.

-   [Knowledge Share Series](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/turing-roche-knowledge-share-series) - this was launched in April 2022 and is a monthly event aiming to bring together members of both Roche and Turing's networks. Its purpose is to showcase partnership updates and research, enable knowledge sharing and give the opportunity to hear different academic and industry perspectives on topics. We'd ask you to please try to attend this event each month. There is also scope for you to present at some of these, please get in touch with Vicky if interested.

-   [Community GitHub Repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-roche-partnership) - this is our GitHub repository, which contains project and community related documentation from our partnership as we are keen to work in the open. Feel free to contribute via pull requests, issues etc.

#### Partnership Ways of Working

#### Roche Data & Systems Onboarding

You may be using Roche's Clinico-Genomic Database (CGDB) and the Apollo platform (a cloud compute environment) for some of your partnership research. A document giving an overview of these systems, tools and data is on the Google Drive. Any questions can be directed to Sarah McGough.

##### Slack

Turing Institute workspace:  <https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/general/>. There are multiple Slack channels which are used by the broader Turing Community, including researchers. It is a mixture of informal, social, and technical. Please ensure you sign up to Turing's Slack Workspace as this doesn't happen automatically. Suggested channels of interest: #health, #tps, #causal-inference

Turing-Roche Slack workspace: <https://forms.gle/iEuDrC9Nb4w63YtWA> We built an engaged community during the Structured Missingness workshops and we would therefore encourage you to use the Turing-Roche Slack workspace (separate from the Turing Institute workspace) to tap into and collaborate with this community, which we also hope will grow with various partnership activities. The workspace is open to anyone to join- we advertise the link on our website and during our knowledge share events.

You can use the #general channel for any help with scientific queries, information gathering or to crowdsource ideas/discussions. You're also welcome to set up private channels for your project or to collaborate with another funded project. Vicky can assist you with this if needed.

Our Slack Workspace policy can be found [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-roche-partnership/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

##### Contact

If you have a query, project issue, a request for resources, or a request for training from Turing or Roche, then your first port of call should be Vicky Hellon, our Community Manager. You can message her on Slack or email her (vhellon@turing.ac.uk). She will answer, coordinate and/or escalate your request as needed. 

##### Project Reporting for Partnership Funded Projects

We will ask you to complete a [Sprint Report template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14lFoRdGguZzSKgizpPczLBtRu9A1EojT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116350138558074996716&rtpof=true&sd=true) every 6 months. These will be reviewed at the partnership operational delivery meetings so please do flag any blockers/ highlights for the team to support you on. Their purpose is to enable research rather than distract you from it. The reports will not be made publicly available, however we may include updates from them in our quarterly partnership reports (starting Spring 2023) so please make a note in them if anything is partnership confidential.

We also will catch-up with you at regularly scheduled meetings. These meetings are for further discussion of any project updates, blockers, collaboration with other teams and an opportunity to discuss anything we can support you with to ensure your project is successful. Our project manager Alvaro will discuss best time slots with you and email you the meeting series for your calendar.

-   Monthly: Project Lead* to meet with Partnership Team (Chris Harbron, Ben MacArthur, Sarah McGough, Rohan Chakraborty) for ~30 minutes to give updates and discuss direction of project

-   Quarterly: Both SM Project Leads and team (i.e co-PIs, PDRAs) convene to share updates, explore any synergies- e.g style of a lab meeting

-   Ad-hoc meetings: We may ask you to present about your project at Turing internal meetings e.g coffee chats or at our [Turing-Roche Knowledge Share series](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/turing-roche-knowledge-share-series). The Community Manager may also schedule catchup meetings with you to discuss any training/resources, help embed you in Turing networks etc.

* For these meetings we ask the project lead to attend, however we're more than happy for any other project team members to attend if they'd like to

##### Reporting for Partnership Senior Postdoctoral Research Associates

We don't have a formal reporting process in place for our central partnership Senior Postdoctoral Research Associates, however our current PDRA Rohan sends short monthly reports on his work which are stored in the Google Drive. We would encourage our next PDRA to do the same.

##### Referring to the Partnership 

We don't currently have a partnership publication to cite- so please link to our webpage [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership). When referring to the partnership please use the term 'Turing-Roche Strategic Partnership'.

##### Publication Process

-   A proposed publication shall be submitted to the Reviewing Party (the partnership team) prior to submission in order to be able to make comments on the Publishing party's proposed publications

-   Comments will be provided within 30 days

-   All reasonable comments will be incorporated (unless the changes will adversely compromise the science)

-   No confidential or non-public IP will be contained in the proposed publication, without prior written consent

-   The Reviewing Party can request a 90-day delay to submission to publish, which may include reasonable additional delay requests to prevent IP or confidential information being compromised or lost 

-   The Partnership is committed to open science practices and we ask that you publish your paper either in an open access journal, or make the final version of it openly available e.g through a postprint (green open access)

We will also help you promote your partnership publication through avenues like the Turing blog, social media etc.

##### Documentation Storage

We currently store partnership documentation in two locations - a shared Google Drive (owned by Roche) and the previously mentioned [community GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-roche-partnership). 

In the spirit of transparency and open science, we try to store the majority of our documentation on the GitHub repository. However, this is balanced with the need to keep certain aspects of the partnership private and such documents are stored in Google Drive. You can find out more about the criteria for where something is stored [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mTNkq-P-hhnzcMccTl53FOcnVYUOAj0RVRD4fUnAM0w/edit).

For partnership research (e.g funded projects), you will need to make a private Roche GitHub repository for your data and code as this cannot be publicly available. More information in the Turing-Roche Data & Systems onboarding doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17GaNEtrt1Jpxw-H5OGKvITHWZ5xISsUXlqZ4FPb9kYc/edit). When you are publishing we will ask you to work with the Roche team to generate some form of synthetic data to ensure reproducibility. 

##### The Turing Way

The [Tools, Practices and Systems Programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) at the Turing is a cross-cutting set of initiatives, which seek to build open source infrastructure that is accessible to all.

A key part of this is the [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) - an open-source community-driven guide to reproducible, ethical, inclusive, and collaborative data science. The goal is to provide all the information that data scientists in academia, industry, government and the third sector need at the start of their projects to ensure that they are easy to reproduce and reuse at the end.

As it is a good place to start understanding the reproducible practices in place at the Turing. We would encourage you to have a quick browse of the guide to see if anything in it (e.g a concept, tool or method) could be of use to you and your partnership project. If there are concepts you'd like to explore further (e.g BinderHub), then Vicky can look at setting up training workshops for you. 

The book content is also ever-evolving, so we also would welcome contributions! You can find out more [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) or again get in touch with Vicky.

### Networking in the Alan Turing Institute

Collaboration is at the heart of the Turing Institute and we're keen for you to make useful and interesting connections and feel fully embedded within the institute. This [document](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-roche-partnership/blob/main/communications/turing-roche-engagement-opportunities.md)  details a number of areas in the institute where you can explore and get involved.
