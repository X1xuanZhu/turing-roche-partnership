# The Turing-Roche Strategic Partnership

Welcome to community repository for the [Turing-Roche Strategic Partnership](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership)! ðŸŽ‰ Here you'll find project and community related documentation from our partnership.

## Background

The Alan Turing Institute and Roche officially set up our five year strategic partnership in June 2021 following a successful [Turing Institute Data Study Group Hackathon](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/publications/data-study-group-final-report-roche) and a 12 week research project on lung cancer treatment. 
 
The **'North Star'** of our five year partnership is to _enable the generation of insights to better understand patient and disease heterogeneity and its relevance to clinical outcomes at an unprecedented level of precision in order to improve clinical care_.

We will be covering multiple research and community activities to work towards our North Star, as well as building strong connections and collaborations between the Alan Turing Institute, Roche and the wider community. You can find more info on the partnership, who's involved and our current projects on our [website](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership).
