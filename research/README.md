# Turing-Roche Partnership Research

Due to the broad nature of our North Star (*'To enable the generation of insights to better understand patient and disease heterogeneity and its relevance to clinical outcomes at an unprecedented level of precision in order to improve clinical care'*), the partnership has decided to focus on certain research themes across the 5 years. You can find more information about activities under each of our research themes on our [webpage](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership).
