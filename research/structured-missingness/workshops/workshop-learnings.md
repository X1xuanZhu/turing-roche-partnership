# Community recommendations for next set of workshops and funding call

In November and December 2021 we ran three workshops on the theme of Structured Missingness (SM), with an associated funding call afterwards to support the ideas developed in the workshop. Overall the format broadly worked and we are aiming to run a similar programme for the next theme. This document aims to reflect on what worked well and what we can improve for next time. 

### What worked

* Timings seemed to work well- think we should keep the rough format of three 2 hour workshops, the first 2 a week apart and the 3rd slightly more spaced with room for co-working sessions
* Format of initial discussions for the 1st workshop, focused breakout rooms (with prior whiteboarding) for the 2nd workshop and presenting research ideas for the 3rd workshop also worked well- think cohesive ideas and collaboration in presentations at the 3rd workshop reflected this 
* Positive feedback on co-working and Slack _"I am very grateful for the continuous check-ins that really engaged me into the projects. And I believe the workshop was a great networking space, besides the funding call purpose."_
* First workshop held on Hopin, second and third on Zoom. Zoom seemed sufficient- majority of people were familiar with it and breakout rooms/share screen functions worked smoothly 
* Attendance good throughout and good conversion for applying for funding- 36 ‘external’ attendees at first workshop, 26 at the 3rd workshop and 15 applied for funding
* Mix of universities- researchers from around 20 different institutions attended

### What can be improved

* Slightly rushed preparations as the Community Manager had recently started on the project and was not involved in initial planning
* Zoom limitations- a little clunky to move around rooms, however not sure other online alternatives would solve this issue
* Was also hard to tell who was moving between rooms and to keep the discussions flowing- didn’t want to limit people to a room, but too much hopping around meant the discussions were fractured. People were allocated a set time to move rooms so not sure how we could improve this? 
* Not much discussion time in the third workshop as there were a lot of presenters - could extend the length of this session or tweak format?
* Funding call running over Christmas break meant we were unable to organise co-working sessions if people wanted to work together on funding applications
* Some confusion around the overall goals of the workshops. Now that we have piloted it successfully, we will be able to make clear funding and each workshop format from the start 
* Mainly UK universities attending and majority senior researchers- can do more work to attract diverse attendees 

### Workshop recommendations



* Run all workshops on Zoom to encourage more community feel, less ‘formal’ 
* Plan workshop format in advance so can have this available pre-registration for attendees
* Have funding call info available (doesn’t need to be long- just a blurb about secondments etc) pre-registration 
* Have a few co-working sessions in the diary so research leads are available and can gauge interest to go ahead from workshop attendees
* Extend the 3rd workshop by half an hour to allow for more discussion time or change format?
* Advertise workshops to ECR communities (Turing networks/enrichment students, any relevant ECR communities at Roche?) to get broader career attendance. Do we want broader international attendance? If so think about how to reach these networks

## SM Funding Call

### What worked



* Seemed to be good enthusiasm around the call anecdotally- queries and engagement post the workshops. 42% of workshop attendees applied for the funding and majority of applications were collaborative with other workshop attendees
* Good standard of applications- over 10 different universities involved in applications, and mix of disciplines/areas e.g Visualisation, Bayesian Modelling, Imputation, Graphical Models, Network Science, Deep Learning, Benchmarking, Adaptive Designs 

### What can be improved



* Quite a lot of queries about the secondment model via email and the Q&A session- any way to make this information clearer/more upfront?
* Not able to fund many projects due to budget constraints, which means losing a lot of researchers and work from the workshops as hard to keep them engaged without funding resource. Received only 18 month funding applications, rather than a mix of short and long term projects.

### Funding call recommendations



* Consider timeline needed to prepare funding call and plan ahead accordingly to ensure we’re not rushed- infographic on timings [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cHdDgWhLjP-lVjX52DyvxZCqsc_FSDNu/view?usp=sharing)
* Be transparent about funds available (at least a ballpark) so researchers can budget accordingly. Suggest we have 2 separate ‘pots’- one for longer term or high impact projects and one for pilot or short term projects that support prototypes and testing of new ideas. This process will allow researchers to apply for both pots (saves us going back and forth with them to ask if they can make their project smaller) and allows us to fund more of a diverse mix of projects - works for the agile approach that the partnership is aiming for
* We should consider allocating a small proportion of the funding to engage and support the community we build through workshops or other routes post the funding calls. These community initiatives can be built on successful models from Software Sustainability Institute Fellows network, Turing Fellow programme and community ‘support’ grants (such as the [Code for Science Event fund](https://eventfund.codeforscience.org/welcome/)). For example, a fellows network under the Turing-Roche partnership has the potential to bring together interested researchers to work on their ideas relevant for the partnership or participate in knowledge sharing opportunities. These opportunities can be designed to be impactful, value aligned and in a way that wouldn’t require access to Roche data or long term investments

# Considerations for having workshops in-person/hybrid vs virtual

### Logistics
* Would need to have a virtual joining option available- for inclusivity and flexibility. Need to think about the tools to best support this to ensure equity. 
* Where we would host- Turing/Roche and what costs would we cover- travel, sustenance
* 3 separate workshops in person would be a large commitment

### Structure of the event

If we wanted to hold the event in person (with virtual add on) then would suggest combining workshops 1 and 2 into one event or all 3 workshops into one event. 

#### Potential format 1

Hold a 3-4 hour in person workshop with potential format:

* Intro and background from research leads
* 4 breakout rooms (would we need to book different physical rooms?) on broad areas pre chosen by research leads- research leads to facilitate discussions and whiteboard ideas coming through documented on a virtual whiteboard so virtual attendees can also contribute
* Everyone in room back together- research leads show their whiteboards, group discussion. Discussion to breakdown research ideas into more narrow areas
* Break
* Breakout rooms on more narrow areas- attendees to facilitate and research leads to rotate to help. Have a virtual room in each breakout room- guidelines for facilitators to ensure they are included. Attendees able to switch between rooms- need to think about how best to facilitate this?
* Final discussion?

Then would have virtual co-working sessions organised, hold workshop 3 online for presentations and discussion as we did originally. 

#### Potential format 2

Same as above but all day workshop. 



* For the narrowed down breakout rooms- have longer discussion time and ask them to present at the end of the day. Would likely be more preliminary ideas rather what would be presented in a separate 3rd workshop
* Can then support with co-working sessions post the workshops for developing funding calls, bulking out what was presented at 3rd workshop 

#### Potential format 3

Have workshops 1 and 2 online, run similar format as before and have online co-working sessions after.

Have workshop 3 in person- presentations and celebrations of the work everyone has achieved together- foster a sense of community for funding calls and beyond. 

### Feedback

Not many people filled in the feedback survey- suggested that we have 10 mins at the end of the last event to get people to fill it in so we actually have some!

Can also check in later and see effects its had downstream- are people still collaborating a month later- checking in post funding call for feedback?
