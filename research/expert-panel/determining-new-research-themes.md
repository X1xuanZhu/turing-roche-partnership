## Expert Panel helping us to determine next research themes for the partnership to pursue

**Turing-Roche partnership North Star: To enable the generation of insights to better understand patient and disease heterogeneity and its relevance to clinical outcomes at an unprecedented level of precision in order to improve clinical care**

As the partnership is running for 5 years and our North Star is quite broad there are many directions we could take. Our initial theme was ‘structured missingness’ and we are now looking for new themes and areas we can pursue for 2022 and beyond. We are using the expert panel to help us narrow down areas of interest, tell us what’s ‘hot’ and help us estimate the complexity/scoping we may need to do in each area.

At the second expert panel meeting we prepared [diagram 1](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-roche-partnership/blob/main/research/expert-panel/Potential%20Project%20ideas%20for%20the%20Turing-Roche%20partnership%20(1).pdf) which has all the potential ideas the partnership team initially came up with (shown at the launch event). We had presentations on 3 of the ideas: Realistic estimates of prediction uncertainty from ML, Prognostic/Predictive modelling and Multi-Modal Data. Expert panel members then had 3 votes each to vote on areas they thought we should pursue as a partnership.

We then took each area that had 2 votes or more and made a whiteboard for each ‘theme’ [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-roche-partnership/blob/main/research/expert-panel/Expert%20Panel%20Whiteboarding-%20specific%20research%20questions%20for%20topics%20and%20ranking.pdf). We asked expert panel members to add specific research questions under each theme that we could potentially explore as a way to ‘narrow down’ the themes.

All of those research question stickies were then transferred to a Miro Board. Ben and Chris Harbron went through the stickies and due to the amount of them, grouped them into a smaller number of specific research questions- i.e refined them into defined areas for potential exploration. They then ranked these questions by relevance to the partnership’s North Star/Roche’s interests- lower interest, medium interest, high interest.

As its difficult to rank ‘complexity’ of these research questions, we’ve decided instead to ask the expert panel members to rank what we should do with the questions into one of 3 options: a initial scoping/starter project that could be done by our postdocs in house, a 6-12 month pilot project that could be done e.g by our partner unis or a major research project. Basically asking them to rank do we know enough about this area to start a major research project or do we need initial scoping first. Whiteboard for this ranking process [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-roche-partnership/blob/main/research/expert-panel/Expert%20Panel%20Whiteboarding-%20specific%20research%20questions%20for%20topics%20and%20ranking.pdf).

We will then have a face to face meeting to make a final decision.
